NAME
    TestML::Tiny - Single File Subset of TestML

SYNOPSIS
        use TestML::Tiny;
        TestML::Tiny->new(
            testml => join('', <DATA>),
        )->run;

        sub uppercase {
            my ($self, $string) = @_;
            return uc($string);
        }

        __DATA__
        %TestML 0.1.0

        Plan = 6

        *text.uppercase == *upper
        *upper == *text.uppercase
        *upper.uppercase == *text.uppercase

        === Test one
        --- text: TestML is Tiny!
        --- upper: TESTML IS TINY!

        === Test two
        --- text
        Test, Test, Test…
        --- upper
        TEST, TEST, TEST…

DESCRIPTION
    TestML is a programming language agnostic, data driven testing language.
    It is a descendent of Perl's Test::Base, made to work in any programming
    language.

    Some projects only need a subset of TestML, and would like it to be in a
    single file that ships with their project. TestML::Tiny aims to be that.

HOW TO TESTML
    TestML is really clean and simple in practice, but it involves learning
    a few new concepts. There's TestML code and data sections, bridge
    classes, and runner files.

    The best start is to see it in practice. eq Look through a test suite
    like the one in here.

STATUS
    This 0.0.3 version is not fully functional yet. Only the data section
    parser works.

    This version is being used in YAML::Tiny development.
